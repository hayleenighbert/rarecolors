I created a palette of some of the rare pigments that were collected by Edward Forbes, a historian and director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University from 1909 to 1944. It is a color swatch that I think compliments each other quite nicely.

#Pigments used
- Red oxide 915652
- Green oxide 6c9e7b
- Yellow ochre d9be87
- Metallic brown caa571
