# Rare Colors
Experimentation with the rarest color palette in the world.

## Mock up in Sketch 3
I created a palette/swatch of some of the rare pigments that were collected by Edward Forbes, a historian and director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University from 1909 to 1944. It is a color swatch that I think compliments each other quite nicely. First I did a mockup with Sketch and then translated that to HTML5/CSS3, imported the palette shapes as SVG for quicker load time, and used Google's Material Design.
